Task-04: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
In this task, we perform sentiment analysis on social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics, products, or brands. The goal is to analyze text data, extract emotions or sentiments (positive, negative, neutral), and visualize overall sentiment trends to gain meaningful insights.

Steps included:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset (cleaning text, removing stopwords, tokenization).

Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment classification.

Using models or tools like TextBlob, VADER, or machine learning classifiers to determine sentiment scores.

Visualizing results through bar charts, word clouds, or pie charts to showcase sentiment distribution.

Interpreting patterns and trends to understand audience perceptions.
